# Custom Types and Supported Platforms

Not much here to look at since the only implmented custom type is interval
for PostgreSQL. No worry more to come and for different platforms.

|   Type    |           Class                       | PostgreSQL |  MySQL |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|
| interval  | `Nasumilu\DBAL\Types\IntervalType`    |     âœ“      |        |
